Hereby is the newly finished report, it has two parts added:
1: The needed mathematics (I am not sure if I showed alot of details or the opposite) from the paper I was assigned to read in one of our meetings ( https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/21683/JL_RIP.pdf?sequence=1)
2: the missing part from notes.tex file aploaded on Github.
Still, the report is ill-formated and ill-organized a little bit but I think it is a good move till now and it will be re-organized later.
